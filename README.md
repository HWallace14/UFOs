# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to help our friend Dana create a website that her fellow UFO enthusiasts could use to search for different UFO sightings around the globe. The objective was to create a user-friendly website that could help further the research of anyone who was looing to learn more about the unknown.

## Results

### Filterability and Ease of Use

The web page is very easy to use, because we made it that way. There are text boxes on the left hand side that state which kind of information that they take in (see below):

These fields "listen" for any changes that are made whenever you data into one of them and then the data is used to filter the table until you get the specific results that you were looking for. For example, if you wanted to look for a sighting on the 1 of january you would type in 1/1/2010 into the Enter Date field, like so:

This would leave you with only sightings from 1/1/2010 on in the table.

If you wanted to get more specific than that then you could simply enter more information into the other fields until you get the desired results:

## Summary

### What do I think?

While I believe this is a good design for a website I do find it to be kind of limited in its scope. A drawback that I see is that the users have no way of entering their own data into the table in order to gather new information or spread their story to the wider world for other researchers. To that end I'd like to make two suggestions for further development:

1) A sighting report function should be added so that fellow UFOlogists can report their sightings and add it to the master table. This would allow a steady stream of new information without having to continuously go out and find it. The information comes to you!

2) An interactive map of the sightings should be added as a method of visualization. This might help with noticing any patterns that might become more visible with a top-down view of the world (like the UFOs would have.)
